# Usage

This guide runs sessions on a machine set up with [Setup](SETUP.md). A session is one
agent learning one task: it explores, writes a robot program, and is then evaluated on
the task's 50 official LIBERO init states, or on one of LIBERO-PRO's perturbations of them.
Each session owns its simulators, MCP service, agent process and storage, so several
sessions run in parallel on one or more GPUs without
sharing state.

Every action has a terminal command; the [dashboard](../services/dashboard/README.md)
is a front end to the same commands.

| Step | Dashboard | Terminal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prepare | **New session** → **Prepare** | `runtime/envs/host/bin/python scripts/configure_auto_research.py ...` |
| Launch | **Launch** (headless) | `bash scripts/start_auto_research_agent.sh --config <session>/operator-input.json` |
| Stop | **Stop** | `bash scripts/stop_auto_research_agent.sh --config <session>/operator-input.json` |
| Resume | **Resume** (headless) | `bash scripts/start_auto_research_agent.sh --config <session>/operator-input.json --resume` |
| Move to another GPU | - | `bash scripts/move_session_gpus.sh --config <session>/operator-input.json --sim-gpu <index or UUID>` |

Sessions live in `runtime/auto-research/<session-id>/`, where the ID is the creation
time and a random suffix, for example `20261013T120000Z_1a2b3c4d5e`.

## 1. Prepare a session

Preparing writes `<session>/operator-input.json` and starts nothing: no model call and
no simulator. It checks the task's layouts, maps the GPU to its UUID, and checks that the
demonstrations the session will show the agent are installed.

```bash
runtime/envs/host/bin/python scripts/configure_auto_research.py \
    --task libero_spatial_0 --sim-gpu 0 --episodes 16
```

It prints the configuration path and the launch command. A configuration is used once:
to change a setting, prepare a new session.

### Tasks

The 40 tasks of LIBERO's four ten-task suites, named `<suite>_<index>` in the official suite
order: `libero_spatial_0`..`libero_spatial_9`, `libero_object_0`..`9`, `libero_goal_0`..`9`
and `libero_10_0`..`9`. Their step limits are the public evaluation runners' per suite:
spatial 220, object 280, goal 300 and libero_10 520 control steps at 20 Hz. LIBERO-PRO's
perturbations are not separate tasks but formal layout collections of the same task; see
[LIBERO-PRO backend](LIBERO_PRO_BACKEND.md#tasks-layouts-and-scoring).

Some settings are fixed for LIBERO-PRO (`services/benchmarks.py`). Passing another value is
an error that names the reason, for example
`--task-rules does not apply to LIBERO-PRO sessions: ...`.

### Settings

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--task` | required | Task name |
| `--sim-gpu` | required | Simulator GPU index or UUID. Agents have no GPU |
| `--episodes` | 5 | Exploration episodes (1..1000; the dashboard allows 2..1000). Each rehearsal uses one |
| `--exploration-envs` | 1 | Simulator environments the agent can use at once (1..8); see [section 6](#6-parallel-exploration-and-subagents) |
| `--subagents` | 0 | Concurrent subagents (0..8). 0 means one per environment when there are several, none with one |
| `--agent-cli` | `codex` | `codex`, `claude`, `dsh` or `kimi` |
| `--agent-provider` | `openrouter` | Provider for the selected harness: OpenRouter, vendor API, vendor account or `custom`; see [Agent harnesses](https://github.com/robot-agent-exploration/rax/blob/main/docs/AGENT_HARNESSES.md). Codex uses its provider profile |
| `--agent-effort` | `xhigh` | Reasoning effort, `xhigh` or `max`, for the agent and its formal copies |
| `--external-perception` | `on` | `off` removes the external Gemini tool and disables its credential loading; use the agent model's own vision |
| `--observation-profile` | `rgbd` | `rgbd`, or `rgb-only` (no depth or camera geometry) |
| `--demonstration-context` | `terminal_state` | Demonstration images from the installed demonstrations ([Setup, step 5](SETUP.md#5-demonstrations)): `none`, `terminal_state` (their final third-person frames) or `completion_sequence` (ordered keyframes) |
| `--agent-formal` | `off` | Evaluation mode: `off` (code mode) or `on` (live copies); see [section 4](#4-evaluation) |
| `--formal-eval-seed` | 1 | Formal layout collection: 1 (official LIBERO), 2 (swap), 3 (object), 4 (language) or 5 (task, agent formal only) |
| `--formal-episodes` | 50 | Official init states to evaluate (1..50) |
| `--formal-workers` | 4 | Formal episodes run at once (1..16) |
| `--formal-seed` | 0 | First official init state (0..49) |
| `--exploration-collection` | 0 | Exploration layouts: 0 (fresh resets of the original task) or 6 (fresh resets of the swap perturbation, for the second stage in [section 5](#5-second-stage-adapting-to-the-swap-perturbation)) |
| `--exploration-start-seed` | 0 | First exploration layout |
| `--formal-context` | `compact` | Agent formal: the conversation each copy carries, `resume` (whole), `compact` (summarized) or `clear` (none) |
| `--transfer-parts` | `memory,code,handoff` | Agent formal: workspace folders each copy carries |
| `--transfer-mb` | 100 | Cap on the carried folders (1..1024 MB) |
| `--adaptation-source` | none | A finished session whose agent continues here; see [section 5](#5-second-stage-adapting-to-the-swap-perturbation) |
| `--adaptation-context` | `compact` | Second stage: the conversation carried from the source (`resume` carries all of it) |
| `--recording-gib` | 10 | Size limit of a robot program's output folder and of a submitted bundle (recorded episode data is not capped) |

Fixed for LIBERO-PRO: `--task-rules public` (`TASK.md` gives the official instruction only),
`--episode-reviews off` (the simulator writes no ground-truth reports), `--expert-demonstrations 0`
(there are no complete expert episodes) and `--write-handoff off` (a second stage carries
code, memory and the conversation instead).

The dashboard form holds the same settings except `--recording-gib`, which keeps its
default there.

## 2. Launch

```bash
bash scripts/start_auto_research_agent.sh --config runtime/auto-research/<session-id>/operator-input.json
```

The launcher builds the session's workspace and CLI home, starts its MCP service, and
runs the agent CLI natively in its sandbox, offline, with the kickoff prompt from the
workspace's `START_PROMPT.md`. Model calls start here and are paid.

- **Interactive (default):** the agent's terminal UI opens in your terminal. The session
  runs until you quit the UI; then the launcher freezes the agent and runs the formal
  evaluation. Closing the terminal stops the session like **Stop** does (a launcher
  started under `nohup` keeps running), so use `tmux` or `screen` for long sessions.
- **Headless:** `--non-interactive` runs the default kickoff without a UI, and
  `--exec-prompt "<text>"` runs your own prompt instead. The dashboard's **Launch** and
  **Resume** run headless, logging to `<session>/agent.log`.

Other launcher flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--profile <name>` | Codex provider profile (default: the name in `<CODEX_HOME>/experiment-profile`, else `openrouter`) |
| `--provider-home <dir>` | Where provider profiles live (default: `$CODEX_HOME`, else `~/.codex`) |
| `--key-file <file>` | OpenRouter key file (default: `~/.codex/secrets/openrouter_api_key` when it exists). Without one, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` serves Gemini and Claude Code's `openrouter` provider; a Codex OpenRouter session needs the file |
| `--agent-binary <file>` | DSH/Kimi: installed CLI executable |
| `--agent-model <id>` | DSH/Kimi: override the provider's default model |
| `--agent-key-file <file>` | DSH/Kimi: private API key file; keep it outside the checkout |
| `--agent-base-url <url>` | DSH/Kimi `custom`: compatible model endpoint |
| `--agent-auth-home <dir>` | DSH/Kimi account: dedicated vendor login directory outside the checkout |
| `--claude-key-file <file>` | Claude `anthropic` provider: an API key file (else `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). `claude-login`: a token file other than the experiment token |
| `--claude-model <id>` | Claude: override the provider's default model. Non-Claude OpenRouter models also replace its auxiliary model aliases |
| `--claude-base-url <url>` | `custom` provider: an Anthropic-compatible endpoint; use `--claude-key-file` for its bearer credential |
| `--prepare-only` | Deploy the workspace and the CLI's session configuration (its sandbox included) and print their paths, then stop without a model call or episode. This uses up the configuration; prepare a new one to run |

Dashboard launches use the defaults of these flags, read in the dashboard's own
environment.

A session runs one launcher at a time; a second launch exits with
`Another launcher is running this session`.

### Remote machines

The dashboard binds only to loopback. Forward its port and open the printed URL locally:

```bash
ssh -L 8765:127.0.0.1:8765 <host>
```

## 3. Monitor, stop and resume

### What a session runs

1. **Explore.** The agent reads `TASK.md` and any demonstration, then works the robot
   through MCP tools. `start_episode` starts the next layout; `evaluate` checks the task;
   `finish` closes the episode. It keeps notes in `memory/` and code in `code/`.
2. **Compile.** It writes `code/<project>/controller.py:main(ctx)`, a program that
   checks what it observes at each step, and tests it unattended.
3. **Evaluate.** Code mode or live copies ([section 4](#4-evaluation)).

### Dashboard

The dashboard lists each session's stage, exploration used, formal success rate, agent
tokens and Gemini spend, live camera frames, every simulator episode's video, results, and the agent and MCP logs. See its [README](../services/dashboard/README.md).

### Session files

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `operator-input.json` | The prepared configuration |
| `configuration.json`, `state.json` | The deployed configuration and the supervisor's state (episodes, bundles, submission, formal batches, Gemini ledger). Both must agree with `operator-input.json` to resume |
| `agent-lifecycle.json` | Launcher status (`preparing`, `running`, `usage_wait`, `formal`, `exited`, `stopped`, `failed`), every earlier attempt, relaunches and agent errors |
| `agent.log`, `frontend.log` | Headless launcher output; the MCP service log, appended per launch |
| `mcp.jsonl` | Every MCP call and its result |
| `agent-login.json` | The session's login: CLI, provider, model and the key file's path (never a secret) |
| `provider-errors.jsonl` | Failed Gemini calls with the provider's raw response |
| `agent-workspace/`, `codex-home/` or `claude-home/` | The agent's workspace and CLI home (settings, conversation and transcripts, from which the dashboard reads token usage) |
| `native/results/<run>/sim/` | Each simulator episode's own records and `sensors.mp4` |
| `exploration/` | The episode ledger of parallel exploration |
| `formal.json` | What ran after exploration: `exploration_incomplete`, `frozen`, `completed` or `failed` with the error |
| `formal-scores.json`, `agent-formal-scores.json` | Formal results per episode and overall ([section 7](#7-results)) |
| `formal-workers/`, `agent-formal/` | One directory per formal episode: logs, and for live copies their transcripts and notes |
| `published/` | Run artifacts the agent can read (frames, traces, reports), linked into its workspace as `runtime/autonomous_controller` |
| `subagents.json` | Subagents spawned, peak concurrency, calls per agent |
| `gpu-moves.jsonl` | GPU moves of this session |

### Stop

**Stop**, or `scripts/stop_auto_research_agent.sh`, sends the session's launcher SIGTERM
(through a pidfd, never to a recycled PID). The launcher stops the agent, everything it
started and the simulators, and records `stopped`. Budgets are not restored. With one
exploration environment, an episode that was running stays charged; with several,
it is refunded (see [section 6](#6-parallel-exploration-and-subagents)).

### Resume

A stopped, exited, failed or crashed session resumes in its own conversation (Codex
`exec resume`, Claude Code `--resume`) and in the same workspace.

- The agent gets a short prompt to reread `memory/PROGRESS.md` and call `status`;
  `--exec-prompt` replaces it.
- Episodes left live by the previous launcher are recorded as interrupted, leftover
  simulators are stopped, and exploration reopens.
- Token usage over all launches stays in the CLI's transcripts in the session, and the
  Gemini ledger continues.
- Resuming a session whose exploration has closed restarts no agent: it runs only the
  formal steps that have not run. An interrupted agent formal continues with the episodes
  that have no outcome; an interrupted code-mode formal batch is not rerun.
- Resume is refused while the launcher is alive, for a session that was only prepared,
  and for a first launch that failed before its workspace existed (prepare a new
  session then).
- A session that ran its agent in a container (on the container branch) is refused:
  resume it with the branch it started on.

### Move to another GPU

Stop the session first, then:

```bash
bash scripts/move_session_gpus.sh --config <session>/operator-input.json --sim-gpu 1
```

It refuses while any process still uses the session, rewrites the simulator GPU in all
three saved copies, moves agent-formal copies listed on the old GPU, and logs the move to
`gpu-moves.jsonl`. Resume afterwards. Any other change to a launched configuration
prevents resuming.

### Automatic relaunch

In a headless session, the launcher continues the agent's conversation while
exploration is open:

- **Turn ended:** the agent is prompted to continue, at most 3 times per launch.
- **Run failed** (provider overload, broken stream): it continues after 300 s, up to
  5 failures in a row. A run of 30 minutes or more resets the count.
- **Claude `claude-login` usage limit:** the session waits for the window's reset with
  its episodes up (lifecycle `usage_wait`, `usage_limited_until`), then continues, up to
  10 waits per launch.

An interactive session is never relaunched.

## 4. Evaluation

Each session has one evaluation mode, set when it is prepared.

### Code mode (`--agent-formal off`, default)

1. **Register** freezes `code/<project>/` as a bundle without running it.
2. **Rehearse** runs the whole bundle in a fresh exploration episode under formal
   limits, unattended. It uses one exploration episode. A clean rehearsal ran to its end
   without an error, timeout or simulator exit; the task need not succeed.
3. **Submit** takes one cleanly rehearsed bundle and closes exploration. It returns no
   score.

When the agent has ended, the launcher freezes the session (memory, code, handoff and
the conversation) and runs the formal batch: `--formal-episodes` official evaluation
episodes, each in a fresh bubblewrap sandbox and simulator, `--formal-workers` at a time,
with no agent, edits or retries. Programs get 8 GiB of memory, math-library threads for 4
CPUs, a 1 GiB `/tmp`, and no network or GPU.

Episode limits: an episode ends as soon as the official environment reports the task done,
or at the task's step limit; its wall-clock limit is 600 s plus 5 s per control step.

### Live copies (`--agent-formal on`)

Exploration has no `register`, `rehearse` or `submit`; the agent is told to practice:
solve the task, build a controller, and use every episode to test it. Exploration closes
when no episode remains and none is live.

After exploration, one copy of the agent plays each official evaluation episode:

- Each copy gets a fresh workspace with `FORMAL_AGENTS.md` as its `AGENTS.md`,
  `TASK.md`, the robot skills, the carried folders and its conversation
  (`--formal-context`: `compact` runs one forced compaction first).
- Carried folders are packed in the order `handoff`, `memory`, `code`; a folder that
  does not fit in the remaining `--transfer-mb` is left out whole, and later ones may
  still fit. `state.json` records what was carried.
- Copies have robot tools, Gemini and Python on their one environment, but no lifecycle
  tools. They start 60 s apart, `--formal-workers` at a time. A copy whose run fails
  continues after 300 s, up to 5 failures in a row.
- The episode limit is the task's formal limit, with 120 s to wrap up after the episode
  ends.

To spread copies over several GPUs, add `"formal_sim_gpus": ["GPU-...", "GPU-..."]`
(UUIDs) to `operator-input.json` before the first launch. Copy *i* uses entry
*i* modulo the list length.

### More evaluations of a finished session

- **Live copies after code mode:** play a finished code-mode session's evaluation episodes
  with copies of its frozen agent, beside its bundle formal:

  ```bash
  bash scripts/start_auto_research_agent.sh --config <session>/operator-input.json --resume --agent-formal
  ```

  It needs closed exploration.
- **Re-evaluate a rehearsed bundle** on more episodes, without a model:

  ```bash
  PYTHONPATH=. runtime/envs/host/bin/python -m services.controller.parallel_batch \
      --source-session <session> --bundle <bundle-id> \
      --output runtime/auto-research/<new-directory> --episodes 50 --workers 4 --eval-seed 2
  ```

  The bundle must have a clean rehearsal; the source session is not changed.
  `--eval-seed` chooses the formal collection, so this is how a session explored on the
  original task is scored under LIBERO-PRO's swap (2), object (3) and language (4)
  perturbations. The task perturbation (5) changes the goal, which a frozen bundle cannot
  follow; it is scored only by live copies.

## 5. Second stage: adapting to the swap perturbation

The first stage explores only the original task, so its swap score measures robustness to
an unseen perturbation. The optional second stage continues a finished first-stage session
on the swap perturbation itself: an adaptation session with the same task, exploration on
fresh seeded resets of the swap layout (`--exploration-collection 6`, never its official init
states), a small episode budget, and formal on the same 50 held-out swap init states the
first stage was scored on (`--formal-eval-seed 2`).

- The agent carries the source's frozen folders (`--transfer-parts`, `--transfer-mb`)
  and conversation (`--adaptation-context`; `resume` carries all of it); `ADAPTATION.md`
  tells it what changed. Nothing from the source's formal evaluation is carried.
- Carrying a conversation needs the source's agent CLI; `clear` can switch CLIs.
- `TASK.md` then says that both exploration and formal layouts swap objects.

```bash
runtime/envs/host/bin/python scripts/configure_auto_research.py --task libero_goal_1 \
    --sim-gpu 0 --episodes 5 --exploration-collection 6 --formal-eval-seed 2 \
    --adaptation-source runtime/auto-research/<first-stage-session> --adaptation-context resume
```

Score the official layouts (collection 1) afterwards with a re-evaluation
([section 4](#more-evaluations-of-a-finished-session)) to check that the adapted bundle did
not regress.

`--formal-only` evaluates an imported agent without exploring: prepare a session with
`--agent-formal on` and `--adaptation-source`, then launch it with `--formal-only`. Live
copies of the source's frozen agent play the formal episodes.

## 6. Parallel exploration and subagents

With `--exploration-envs N` (2..8) the agent has N simulator environments at once, each
its own episode simulator, started on first use.

- Robot and episode tools take `env_id`; calls to different environments run
  concurrently, and calls to one environment run in order.
- All environments share one episode budget: every start, reset and rehearsal uses one.
- An episode that never ran to its own end (the session stopped, or its environment's
  process failed) is not charged, and its layout is played again next. The agent is told.
  With one environment, every start is charged.
- Rehearsals and formal episodes always use one environment.

`--subagents N` caps concurrent subagents. With one environment and N subagents, the
subagents take turns on the environment. Codex enforces the cap; Claude Code is told it
and is measured. `subagents.json` records spawns, peak concurrency and calls per agent.

Load grows with live environments; see [GPUs](SETUP.md#gpus).

## 7. Results

Results are operator-only; the agent never sees formal results.

- **Per episode:** LIBERO's binary success (the BDDL goal holds when `env.step` reports
  done). There is no partial credit: an episode that errors or stops short of the goal fails.
- **Success rate:** successes over the scheduled episodes. Success needs task success and
  a clean run; other episodes are `unsuccessful` or `error`.
- **Per task and collection:** each batch plays one task on one collection; a suite's
  success rate is the mean over its ten tasks.

Code-mode results: `published/formal_batch.json` and `formal-scores.json`. Live copies:
`published/agent_formal_batch.json` and `agent-formal-scores.json`.

## 8. Gemini

The agent can call `gemini_generate` (`google/gemini-3.8-flash` on OpenRouter), for
example to check an image. Spending has no session limit; one ledger per session covers
exploration, rehearsals, formal episodes and live copies, and the dashboard shows the
spend. Without an OpenRouter key every call answers `Gemini is not configured`.

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Message | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `Controller artifacts must be under <root> (set RAX_ARTIFACT_ROOT to change it)` | Sessions must live under the artifact root, by default the directory `runtime/` links to. Set the variable to that directory or an ancestor |

## DeepSeek Harness and Kimi Code

Select `--agent-cli dsh` or `--agent-cli kimi` when preparing a session.
Both adapters support one exploration environment, no subagents and code formal
evaluation. Set `--agent-effort max` for maximum reasoning.

The [agent harness guide](https://github.com/robot-agent-exploration/rax/blob/main/docs/AGENT_HARNESSES.md)
covers installation, OpenRouter, vendor API keys, account login and compatible
endpoints. Pass credentials to the launcher with `--agent-key-file` for API
access or `--agent-auth-home` for account access.
